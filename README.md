# KitMakesThings

Welcome!

Here you will find the source code for my personal portfolio website.

## Currently under maintenance!

I recently migrated from using strapi to using postgres and decided to update the look and feel of my entire website using Next.js, Tailwind, NextUI and Prisma.

Along with the public facing pages, this site also has a custom CMS dashboard for me to update text information, pictures and add new projects. This dashboard also has the functionality for me to create and track invoices, projects and messages sent through the contact form.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I am a multi disciplined developer making websites, interactive installations and mobile apps using Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript and Unity along with many others.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
